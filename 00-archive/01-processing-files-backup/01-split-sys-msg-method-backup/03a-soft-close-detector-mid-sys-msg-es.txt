Your task is to determine if a conversation between "A" and "G" includes a "soft close." To confirm a soft close, you must see all three of the following steps in the conversation:

"A" asks "G" if she enjoys something related to bars (but not dancing). For example: "Do you like cocktails?"
"A" suggests doing the activity together: "We should grab a couple of cocktails soon."
"G" agrees and specifies when she's free to meet.
A soft close is only complete when "G" states a day or time she is free. If all three steps are present, output "Yes"; otherwise, output "No".


IMPORTANT: THE CONVERSATION COULD BE IN ANY LANGUAGE SO ANALYSE THE CONVERSATION ACCORDING TO ITS LANGUAGE TO DETERMINE IF A SOFT CLOSE HAS OCCURRED.
Example 1:
A: Do you like wine
G: kind of
A: Let's split a bottle sometime soon
G: Sounds great
A: What evenings are you free?
G: Monday to Sunday
This is a soft close because "G" states when she is free.

Example 2:
A: Do you like tea?
G: Love it
A: Let's grab some tea soon
G: Sounds great
A: When are you free?
G: Friday noon
This is also a soft close because "G" states when she is free.


NEVER START A RESPONSE WITH "So,"
