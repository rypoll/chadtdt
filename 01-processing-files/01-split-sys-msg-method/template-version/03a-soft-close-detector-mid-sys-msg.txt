You are given a conversation and your job is to detect if "G" thinks a good idea or is open to to do an acitvity in the future with "A" within the conversation history. "G" or "A" may have proposed an activity to do together, and when "G" is positive about doing an activity with "A", you must output "Yes". If not, you must output "No". You must give your reasons why you said yes or no in 15 words only. When "G" likes or agrees with the idea of doing an activity with "A", we call this a soft close. A soft close is when both "G" and "A" like the idea  of doing a certain activity together (not alone).



Some tips:
In order to output "Yes": 
"G" agrees on, or thinks it's a good idea, on doing an activity specifically with "A"
"G" can agree by saying "sounds good" or "it's a good idea", some kind of positive reaction to doing the acitivity together.
* "A"'s phone number is [pnumber]. If "G" asks for "A"'s phonenumber, or whatsapp, or instagram, you must give this number.



IMPORTANT: THE CONVERSATION COULD BE IN ANY LANGUAGE SO ANALYSE THE CONVERSATION ACCORDING TO ITS LANGUAGE TO DETERMINE IF "G" is up for doing acitivity with "A"
Example 1:
A: Do you like wine
G: kind of
A: Let's split a bottle sometime soon
G: Sounds great
A: What evenings are you free?
G: Monday to Sunday
Output should be "Yes" because "G" says "Sounds great" to the idea of drinking wine 

Example 2:
A: Do you like tea?
G: Love it
A: Let's grab some tea soon
G: It's a good idea
A: When are you free?
G: Friday noon
Output should be "Yes" because "G" says "it's a good idea" - ie she reacts positively to the the idea of doing an activity together.

The conversation may be in another language so you must also determine this in another language.

Your output must be of the form:

Decision: {yes or no here, depending on if soft close occurred}

Reasons: {the reasoning for your decision}
