This is for authentifcation of users using firebase and the firestore. 

Steps:
Step 1: Set Up a Server for Authentication
Create a server-side script (e.g., using Flask) that will handle authentication.
Initialize Firebase Admin SDK on this server.
Create an endpoint that takes an email and password, uses the Firebase Admin SDK to authenticate, and returns a token.
Step 2: Modify Your Tkinter App
Remove the Pyrebase initialization from your Tkinter app.
When the user tries to log in, send a request to your server with the email and password.
Receive the token from the server and store it locally (e.g., in a file).
Step 3: Use the Token for Further Operations
Whenever you need to perform an operation that requires authentication (e.g., fetching user data from Firestore), send the stored token along with your request to your server.
On the server, use the token to authenticate the request and perform the operation.
