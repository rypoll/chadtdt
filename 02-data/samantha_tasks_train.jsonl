Here's a step-by-step guide to changing a flat tire:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As soon as you notice the flat tire, slowly reduce your speed and look for a level, stable area to stop your vehicle. Make sure you're away from traffic.\n2. Turn on your hazard lights and apply the parking brake.\n3. Retrieve your spare tire, jack, and lug wrench from the vehicle storage.\n4. Use the lug wrench to slightly loosen the lug nuts on the affected tire (typically counterclockwise). Do not remove them yet.\n5. Consult your vehicle's manual to find the appropriate spot to place the jack for lifting the vehicle. Once correctly positioned, elevate the car until the flat tire is about six inches off the ground.\n6. Remove the lug nuts completely and then carefully take off the flat tire. Set it aside.\n7. Align the holes of the spare tire with the lug nut posts and place it on the vehicle.\n8. Hand-tighten the lug nuts onto the posts, then use the lug wrench to secure them further, turning clockwise. Avoid overtightening.\n9. Lower the vehicle back to the ground and remove the jack.\n10. Tighten the lug nuts completely in a crisscross pattern. This ensures even pressure distribution across the tire.\n11. Store the flat tire, jack, and lug wrench back into your vehicle, turn off your hazard lights, and ensure the area is clear before driving away."}]}
